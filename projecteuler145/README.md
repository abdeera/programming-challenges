This code resolves projecteuler problem nÂ°145.

Problem stated here: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler145

The program consists of extracting reversible numbers for each test case most rapidly as it can using a mathematical breakthrough, while it requires much memory for callstack. I intend to deal with that in the future.

I dont restrict any use of this code or any other IN THE SAME DIRECTORY, you can modify/copy/distribute it as you like without the need to mention me.
